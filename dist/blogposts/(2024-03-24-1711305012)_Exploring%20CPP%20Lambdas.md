# Lambdas in C++ ü¶ôüêë 

Today I'm doing to give a gentle introduction to operators, lambdas and
functional programming in c++. If you have never used them before in C++ and
always wanted to do so this is a good place to start!

## Prelude

If you haven't been able to tell yet, I'm quite fascinated by programming
languages and I'm learning to appreciate the different paradigms out there. One
thing that has caught my eye in the recent months would be declarative
programming.

This might be a little esoteric for the everyday software engineering job, I do
want to take some time to appreciate the consideration and features behind multi
paradigm programming languages and demonstrate how to use them. In doing so,
perhaps the reader will be able to find their own 'why?' of using these.

## The struggle bus

Let me set the stage for you. You are prepping for your techinical interview,
and working on algorithmic problem solving, you're working in c++ (everyone has
been telling you to switch to python and focus on fighting the problem not the
tools, but you are ~~stubborn~~ set on improving your profficiency so you
soldier on) you get hit with SIGSEV heap corruptions & stack overflows (skill 
issue tbh).


## Paradigm Perspectives

There are two parts to understanding a computer program:

- understanding your data
- working your logic on top of it.

These two concepts can broadly be classified under imperative vs declarative
paradigm and I think you can tell which paradigm focuses on what.

I won't get into the debacle about immutability and state changes and what not,
because the functional programming community has tons to say about that. Instead
I want to present some use cases for me, and how programming in a fucntional or
declaritive way has been beneficial. Although I do strongly believe mutability
is the root cause of 90% of my troubles...

For me the *ideal balance* would be **somewhere in between declarative and
imperative programming**.

## Embracing Declarative Programming

**A word of caution**: Embracing declarative programming requires a **mental
leap of faith**, a journey into a domain where the principles of mathematical
induction, Finite State Machines (FSM), and recursive functions become first
principles.Much like understanding recursion relies on accepting the inductive
hypothesis, declarative programming challenges us to abstract logic when working
with composable units. This paradigm shift is central to functional programming,
emphasizing "what" needs to be done over "how" to do it.

In this realm, the powerful C++ Standard Library comes into play, a treasure
trove I've admittedly underused. It's equipped with a plethora of algorithms and
functional tools designed to take on the brunt of the work, allowing us to write
cleaner, more expressive, and more concise code. By relying on these
well-designed, efficient components, we can dive into functional programming
with the assurance that the Standard Library is not just an supplementary tool
but as a critical ally.

Unfortunately, while I do enjoy being challenged mathematically, I have to admit
I am not the most comfortable with mathematical induction. Sometime's I need the
insight of data and variables to being modified in front of my eyes to open my
mind's eye in following and creating the logic of the program. Part of it that
can be treated with practice and exposure. My aim is to harness the potential of
multiparadigm languages like C++ and Rust, to strike a balance that leans
towards a functional style with practical application.

## Diving into Operators and Lambdas

Now with the motivations out of the way, firstly, I have to give a crash course
on the operator keyword.

In C++, `operator()` is a special member function known as the "function call
operator" or "functor operator." It allows objects of a class to be used with
the same syntax as a function call. This means that when you define
`operator()`, you're essentially defining how instances of your class behave
when they are "called" as if they were functions.

Here's a basic example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Adder {
public:
    int operator()(int a, int b) const {
        return a + b;
    }
};

int main() {
    Adder add;
    int sum = add(3, 4);  // This calls operator() on add, essentially like calling a function.
    std::cout << "Sum: " << sum << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `Adder` is a class with `operator()` defined. When an `Adder`
object is created (`add`), you can "call" it as if it were a function by using
parentheses `(3, 4)`. This implicitly calls `operator()` on the `add` object,
passing `3` and `4` as arguments, and returns their sum.

This concept is commonly used in C++ to create objects that behave like
functions, which is useful in functional programming paradigms, callback
mechanisms, and more.

## More on operators

Of course one example is never enough, so let me serve some more! Here,
`MathOperations` demonstrates the versatility of operator overloading, including
unary and binary operations, enriching the C++ functional toolkit.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class MathOperations {
public:
    MathOperations(int base) : base(base) {}

    int operator()(int x) const {
        return base * x; // Operator () as a functor
    }

    MathOperations operator+(const MathOperations& other) const {
        return MathOperations(base + other.base); // Operator + for adding MathOperations objects
    }

    MathOperations operator-(const MathOperations& other) const {
        return MathOperations(base - other.base); // Operator - for subtracting MathOperations objects
    }

    MathOperations operator*(const MathOperations& other) const {
        return MathOperations(base * other.base); // Operator * for multiplying MathOperations objects
    }
    MathOperations operator-() const {
        return MathOperations(-base); // Unary operator - to negate the base value
    }

private:
    int base;
};

int main() {
    MathOperations adder(10);
    MathOperations subtractor(5);
    MathOperations multiplier(2);

    int result1 = adder(3); // This calls operator() and returns 10 * 3 = 30
    std::cout << "Result of addition: " << result1 << std::endl;

    MathOperations sum = adder + subtractor; // This calls operator+ and creates a MathOperations object with base 10 + 5 = 15
    std::cout << "Result of addition: " << sum(3) << std::endl;

    MathOperations difference = adder - subtractor; // This calls operator- and creates a MathOperations object with base 10 - 5 = 5
    std::cout << "Result of subtraction: " << difference(3) << std::endl;

    MathOperations product = adder * multiplier; // This calls operator* and creates a MathOperations object with base 10 * 2 = 20
    std::cout << "Result of multiplication: " << product(3) << std::endl;

    MathOperations negation = -adder; // This calls the unary operator - and negates the base value of adder
    std::cout << "Result of negation: " << negation(3) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Okay now we are ready to learn how to use lambdas! By the end of this, you
should have another tool that will help you venture into functional programming
:)

## Basic syntax

```cpp
[capture_clause](parameters) -> return_type { body }
```

- **Capture Clause**: This specifies which variables from the surrounding scope
  the lambda function can access.
- **Parameters**: These are the input parameters of the lambda function.
- **Return Type**: This is the return type of the lambda function. It can be
  omitted if the return type can be deduced.
- **Body**: This is the actual implementation of the lambda function.

Using Lambdas:

Lambdas can be utilized in various scenarios:

1. **Function Arguments**: Lambdas can be passed as arguments to other
   functions, allowing for more flexibility in function behavior.
1. **Return Values**: Functions can return lambdas, enabling the creation of
   higher-order functions.
1. **Algorithm Customization**: Lambdas can be used to customize the behavior of
   standard algorithms like `std::sort`, `std::transform`, etc.

Capture Clauses:

Capture clauses determine how variables from the enclosing scope are captured by
the lambda. There are two main capture modes:

- **By Value**: Copies the variable's value at the time the lambda is created.
- **By Reference**: Captures a reference to the variable, allowing the lambda to
  access and modify its value.

I'm going to pick some examples which encapsulate some common pitfalls or things
ot know aobut lambdas. Let's see some typical ways I have been using lambdas:

In algorithmic problems, especially those involving graph traversal like DFS,
lambdas can encapsulate the logic of traversal, making the code concise and
readable.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <functional> // For std::function

int main() {
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> graph;
    std::vector<bool> visited(graph.size(), false);

    std::function<void(int)> dfs = [&](int node) {
        if (visited[node]) return;
        visited[node] = true;
        std::cout << "Visiting node " << node << std::endl;
        for (int neighbor : graph[node]) {
            dfs(neighbor);
        }
    };

    dfs(0); // Start DFS from node 0
    return 0;
}

```

**Key Point**: The `std::function<void(int)>` is used here to declare `dfs` with
a lambda expression. This approach is beneficial when the lambda needs to be
recursive, as it allows the lambda to refer to itself. Capturing `[&]` ensures
that `visited` and the `dfs` function itself are captured by reference, enabling
the recursive calls and updates to the `visited` vector. This is especialy
useful for multi-state dynamic programming problems.

When dealing with priority queues of complex objects, where the comparison is
not straightforward, lambdas can provide a custom comparator.

```cpp
#include <queue>
#include <vector>

struct Item {
    int weight;
    int value;
    // Constructor for convenience
    Item(int weight, int value) : weight(weight), value(value) {}
};

int main() {
    auto comp = [](const Item& a, const Item& b) {
        return a.value < b.value; // Compare by value
    };

    // decltype(comp) automatically deduces the type of the lambda expression
    std::priority_queue<Item, std::vector<Item>, decltype(comp)> pq(comp);

    pq.push(Item(10, 100));
    pq.push(Item(20, 50));
    pq.push(Item(5, 150));

    while (!pq.empty()) {
        Item top = pq.top(); pq.pop();
        std::cout << "Item with weight " << top.weight << " and value " << top.value << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}	
```

**Key Point**: Using `decltype` on the lambda for the comparator type is
necessary because lambda types are unique and unnamed. Here you use the lambda
directly without needing to define a struct or class for the comparison. Then
`decltype` can be used to deduce the type of a lambda expression, which is
particularly useful when the type is complex or verbose to write out.

Example 3: Transforming a Vector with Lambdas

In this example, we'll use a lambda function with `std::transform` to modify the
contents of a vector. This showcases how lambdas can be used for inline
operations and illustrates the use of capture clauses to access external
variables within the lambda.

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int multiplier = 5;

    // Use std::transform with a lambda to multiply each element by 'multiplier'
    std::transform(numbers.begin(), numbers.end(), numbers.begin(),
        [multiplier](int value) -> int {
            return value * multiplier;
        }
    );

    // Print the transformed vector
    std::cout << "Transformed Vector: ";
    for (int value : numbers) {
        std::cout << value << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Key Point**: The lambda captures the `multiplier` variable by value
`[multiplier]`. This means the current value of `multiplier` is used within the
lambda, and any modifications to `multiplier` inside the lambda do not affect
the original variable outside of it. This example also illustrates how
`std::transform` can be used to apply a function (in this case, our lambda) to
each element of a container, modifying the container in place.

The choice of capture by value `[=]`, by reference `[&]`, or a specific variable
`[multiplier]` is crucial for controlling access and modifications to the
external variables within the lambda. This example emphasizes the importance of
understanding capture semantics to avoid unintended side effects or bugs,
especially in more complex applications.

If you were looking to roughly understand how/when to use lambda's this would
have been a perfect place to end it, but carry on further if you

## Quirks and charms

Now, it wouldn't be C++ without some gotcha's. To save you some cryptic
compilation errors or unexecpected behaviour I'm going to touch on some implicit
knowledge you need sometimes to navigate the intricacies.

### Lambda Capture

- **Capture by Reference Lifetime**: When capturing by reference `[&]`, be wary
  of dangling references. The captured variables must outlive the lambda itself.
- **Implicit Capture**: In C++14 and earlier, `[=]` captures variables by value,
  while `[&]` captures by reference. In C++17 and later, if a lambda is defined
  within a scope where variables are captured by reference with `[&]`, C++ will
  implicitly capture any variables used in the lambda body, saving you from
  explicitly listing them.

### Generic Lambdas

In C++14, lambda parameters had to use specific types. C++17 introduced the
ability to use `auto` parameters:

```cpp
auto lambda = [](auto x, auto y) { return x + y; }
```

This allows writing more generic lambdas that can work with different types.

### Lambdas and `constexpr`

C++17 allows marking lambda expressions as `constexpr` if their body is a single
return statement. This enables using lambdas in constant expressions:

```cpp
constexpr auto add = [](int x, int y) constexpr { return x + y; };
constexpr int result = add(1, 2); // OK in C++17
```

### Captureless Lambdas

C++20 introduced the ability to create captureless lambdas, which do not capture
any variables from the enclosing scope. This can improve performance by avoiding
unnecessary copies or references:

```cpp
auto lambda = [=]() constexpr { return 42; };
```

### Template Lambdas

C++20 also introduced template lambdas, allowing you to parameterize lambdas
with types:

```cpp
auto lambda = []<typename T>(T x, T y) { return x + y; };
```

This can be handy for writing generic, reusable lambdas.

### Performance Considerations

Lambdas are essentially compiled as closures, which are objects that capture
variables from the enclosing scope. When you define a lambda, the compiler
generates a new class type that represents the closure object. This closure
object contains the captured variables and the code for the lambda body.

When you create a lambda expression, an instance of this closure object is
constructed, which may involve dynamic memory allocation, depending on the size
of the captured variables. While lambdas are convenient, they can potentially
introduce performance overhead due to the creation of the closure object and the
associated memory allocation/deallocation.

For performance-critical code, it's probably worth considering using traditional
inline functions instead. This can be achieved by either:

1. Defining a separate inline function instead of using a lambda expression.
1. Using C++20's `consteval` functions, which are similar to `constexpr`
   functions but can be used more broadly in constant expressions and allow for
   more complex code.

Speaking of which, optimisatoin is definitely a cool thing to explore. I might
be trying out the
[billion rows challenge](https://www.morling.dev/blog/one-billion-row-challenge/)
sometime soon!
