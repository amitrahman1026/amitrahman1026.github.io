# Welcome to My Personal Website!

Hello and welcome to my personal website! I'm thrilled to have you here. Allow
me to introduce myself and share a bit about my passions and interests in the
world of programming.

## About Me
Hello! I'm Amit, a Computer Engineering student at the National University of 
Singapore (NUS).

Currently, I work as a/an:

- IoT Software Developer at [Kisi](https://www.getkisi.com/about), a security company.

Previously, I've had stints as a/an:

- DevOps Engineer intern at [HydraX](https://www.hydrax.io/about/), a fintech startup
- Fullstack intern at a stealth-mode startup

I'm passionate about the inner workings of software systems and pragmatic
engineering!

## Join Me on This Journey

In this vast sea of information, every bit I learn is a treasure. Each discovery
fuels my curiosity and eagerness to learn more. I believe in the power of
sharing knowledge â€“ what I pick up along my path, I want to put out there for
others. The idea is simple: as I walk this journey, I lay down a trail of insights
and learnings, and I hope that others can run where I've walked.

Feel free to browse through my blog posts, projects, and resources. Hope you 
find something valuable here. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any
questions, suggestions, or if you'd simply like to connect!
