# Welcome to My Personal Website!

Hello and welcome to my personal website! I'm thrilled to have you here. Allow
me to introduce myself and share a bit about my passions and interests in the
world of programming.

## About Me
Hello! I'm Amit, a Computer Engineering student at the National University of 
Singapore (NUS). Currently, I work as an IoT Software Developer at Kisi, but 
I'm taking a leave of absence this semester to focus on my interview 
preparations.

## Rust

Rust has quickly become one of my favorite programming languages. Its focus on
memory safety, fearless concurrency, and performance optimization truly sets it
apart. I enjoy harnessing the power of Rust to build robust and efficient
software solutions.

## Compilers

Compilers have always fascinated me. The way they transform human-readable code
into machine-executable instructions is truly magical. Exploring the
intricacies of compiler design and learning about different optimization
techniques has been a captivating endeavor.

## Linux and OSS

Linux is more than just an operating system for me; it's a philosophy. The
freedom, flexibility, and collaborative nature of the open-source ecosystem
resonate deeply with my values. I take immense pleasure in working with Linux,
understanding its inner workings, and leveraging its power to create impactful
projects.

## Vim

Vim is my preferred text editor, and it has become an essential part of my
programming workflow. The endless customization options, powerful plugins, and
efficient editing capabilities make it a tool I can't live without. I enjoy
diving into Vim's intricacies and continuously discovering new ways to improve
my productivity.

## Join Me on This Journey

I am excited to share my knowledge, experiences, and projects with you through
this website. Together, we can explore the exciting world of Rust, compilers,
Linux, and Vim. Whether you're a fellow enthusiast or just curious to learn
more, I hope you'll find something valuable here.

Feel free to browse through my blog posts, projects, and resources. Don't
hesitate to reach out if you have any questions, suggestions, or if you'd
simply like to connect. Let's embark on this coding adventure together!

Happy coding, Robert Junkins
