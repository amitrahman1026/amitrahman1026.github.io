# Welcome to My Personal Website!

Hi there! I'm Amit, a budding computer engineering student at the National
University of Singapore. My journey in this field is driven by a deep passion
for understanding the intricate layers of software systems and the art of
pragmatic engineering. The world of computer science is vast and endlessly
fascinating – so much so that I often find myself thinking about the sheer
volume of knowledge out there that I might never fully explore. But that's the
beauty of it, isn't it?

## Join Me on This Journey

In this vast sea of information, every bit I learn is a treasure. Each discovery
fuels my curiosity and eagerness to learn more. I believe in the power of
sharing knowledge – what I pick up along my path, I want to put out there for
others. The idea is simple: as I walk this journey, I lay down a trail of insights
and learnings, and I hope that others can run where I've walked.

find something valuable here. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any
questions, suggestions, or if you'd simply like to connect!
