# Dynamic Dispatch

Hi! Welcome to a quick no nonsense tutorial on Dynamic Dispatch and Function
Overloading. We'll take a look at how C++ and Rust does it!

## Dynamic Dispatch

Dynamic dispatch is a **runtime** mechanism that allows a program to call a
function or method based on the actual type of the object, rather than the
declared type of the object. This is achieved through the use of virtual
functions and virtual method tables (vtables).

### C++ Approach to Dynamic Dispatch

1. Defining Virtual Functions:

   A virtual function is **a member function that you expect to be redefined in
   derived classes**. This is similar to abstract methods in java except there
   can be a default implementation for the base class.

   ```cpp
   class Animal {
   public:
       virtual void makeSound() {
           std::cout << "The animal makes a sound" << std::endl;
       }
   };
   ```

1. Implementing Virtual Functions in Derived Classes:

   ```cpp
   class Dog : public Animal {
   public:
       void makeSound() override {
           std::cout << "The dog barks" << std::endl;
       }
   };

   class Cat : public Animal {
   public:
       void makeSound() override {
           std::cout << "The cat meows" << std::endl;
       }
   };
   ```

1. Use Base Class Pointers/References:

   ```cpp
   Animal* animal = new Dog();
   animal->makeSound(); // Calls Dog::makeSound()
   ```

1. **Compiler Generates Vtable**: The compiler generates a virtual method table
   (vtable) for each class that has virtual functions.

1. **Dynamic Dispatch at Runtime**: When the client code calls a virtual
   function through a base class pointer/reference, the compiler looks up the
   appropriate function implementation in the vtable and calls it at runtime.

Here's a sequence diagram illustrating the dynamic dispatch process in C++:

Pretty much the same thing happens in rust.

### Rust Approach to Dynamic Dispatch

1. Defining Traits:

   ```rust
   trait Animal {
       fn make_sound(&self);
   }
   ```

1. Implementing Traits for Concrete Types:

   ```rust
   impl Animal for Dog {
       fn make_sound(&self) {
           println!("The dog barks");
       }
   }

   impl Animal for Cat {
       fn make_sound(&self) {
           println!("The cat meows");
       }
   }
   ```

1. Use Trait Objects:

   ```rust
   let animal: Box<dyn Animal> = Box::new(Dog {});
   animal.make_sound(); // Calls Dog::make_sound()
   ```

1. **Compiler Generates Trait Object**: The Rust compiler automatically
   generates the necessary trait object based on the trait implementations.

1. **Dynamic Dispatch at Runtime**: When the client code calls a method on a
   trait object, the compiler looks up the appropriate function implementation
   in the trait object and calls it at runtime.

## Function Overloading

Function overloading in C++ allows you to define multiple functions with the
same name, but with different parameters. The compiler will then choose the
appropriate function to call based on the types and number of arguments passed
at the call site. This is done during **compile time**.

### C++ Function Overloading

1. Overloaded Function Definitions:

   ```cpp
   class Person {
   public:
       void print(int age) {
           std::cout << "Person, age: " << age << std::endl;
       }

       void print(const std::string& name) {
           std::cout << "Person, name: " << name << std::endl;
       }

       void print(int age, const std::string& name) {
           std::cout << "Person, age: " << age << ", name: " << name << std::endl;
       }
   };
   ```

1. **Overload Resolution**: The compiler performs overload resolution at
   compile-time to determine which overloaded function to call based on the
   arguments provided at the call site.

1. **No Vtable Involvement**: Function overloading in C++ does not involve the
   use of a virtual method table (vtable). The compiler selects the appropriate
   overloaded function to call based on the function signature.

### Rust Function Overloading

Rust supports function overloading through the use of trait functions and
associated functions, but with some differences compared to C++:

1. Trait Functions:

   ```rust
   trait Printable {
       fn print(&self);
       fn print_with_message(&self, message: &str);
   }
   ```

1. **Associated Functions**: Rust also supports overloading of associated
   functions, which are similar to static member functions in C++.

1. **No Automatic Conversion**: Rust does not perform automatic type conversions
   when resolving function overloads, unlike C++.

The key differences between C++ and Rust's approach to function overloading are
the use of traits and the lack of automatic type conversions in Rust.
